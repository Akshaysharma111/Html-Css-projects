                <h2>Missile Man of India </h2>
                <p> Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, whose full name is Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was an Indian scientist
                    and politician
                    who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
                    He was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India, and passed away on July 27, 2015.
                    Dr. Kalam was known as the "People's President" because of his down-to-earth and approachable
                    nature.
                    Before his presidency, he had a distinguished career as a scientist, primarily in the field of
                    aerospace engineering.
                    He played a pivotal role in India's civilian space program and military missile development.</p>
